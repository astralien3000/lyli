# lyli

Welcome to the lyli (Lyrical Lisp) programming language repository !

# Disclaimer

This repository is a work in progress and is not intended to be used by anyone unless your are VERY interested in the development of the lyli programming language.

# Basic principle

The basic principle of the Lyli language is to be a Lisp language that looks like C.

But what does it looks like ?

```
fn main() {
  print("Hello, world!")
}
```

Looks more like a mix between Python and Rust, but we will see where it goes.

# Repo structure

- `doc` : Contains various documents about the lyli language
- `example` : Contains various example projects written in lyli
- `lyli.py` : Contains the python implementation of the lyli interpreter
