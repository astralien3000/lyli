# Lyli

Welcome to the Lyli (Lyrical Lisp) programming language repository !

# Disclaimer

This repository is a work in progress and is not intended to be used by anyone unless your are VERY interested in the development of the lyli programming language.

# Basic principle

The basic principle of the Lyli language is to be a Lisp language that looks like C.

But what does it looks like ?

```
fn main() {
  print("Hello, world!")
}
```

Why does it looks more like a mix between Python and Rust ?
Well.. Things happened...
